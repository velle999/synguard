# 35: THE SHIPPED POLICY ACTS NOW. synguard shipped 55 rules and not one of
#   them carried `deny` or `quarantine`: the daemon ran with --mode enforce, so
#   acting was permitted, and nothing loaded ever asked for it. It detected and
#   alerted and had never once stopped anything — which also means its acting
#   path had never been exercised on a real machine.
#   50-default-deny.rules arms three, chosen against one bar: does anything on
#   a working desktop do this, EVER. deny-ld-preload (nothing on Arch manages
#   that file; refusing the READ is what neuters an already-planted rootkit,
#   and glibc treats a failed open as "no preload" so it fails safe),
#   deny-bpf-canary (the positive control — a rule that never fires is
#   indistinguishable from one that does not work), and
#   quarantine-exec-from-dev (SIGSTOP, recoverable, evidence kept).
#   ⚠ NOT armed, with reasons in the file: module loads (DKMS and the NVIDIA
#   driver trip it on a routine `pacman -Syu`, and synapse_kmod is itself DKMS)
#   and shell-from-sshd (sshd execs the account's LOGIN shell, so the example's
#   `path /usr/bin/sh` is either inert or an SSH lockout depending on a setting
#   the file cannot see).
#   ⚠ The two denies sit at priority 0 so they lower to the BPF LSM — below
#   00-base's allow-synguard/allow-synapd nothing can be proved disjoint and
#   lowering refuses. Verified by lower_test, not asserted. The kernel gate
#   still needs --bpf-enforce, which the unit does NOT pass: these are
#   after-the-fact kills until somebody arms it deliberately.
# 36: A KERNEL REFUSAL LEFT NO TRACE. `bpf-lsm: denied=…` was logged exactly
#   once, from the startup banner, and nothing ever re-emitted it — so a gate
#   that had refused four thousand opens and one that had refused none produced
#   identical journals for the life of the process. The single event this
#   subsystem exists to produce was invisible.
#   Found by tools/bpf-enforce-check.sh on the first real run of the gate: it
#   watched the counter across a refusal it had just caused and saw 0 -> 0,
#   because nothing had asked the kernel for the number since boot. The gate
#   was working perfectly; the reporting was not.
#   Now logged ON CHANGE at WARNING (a refusal is rare and worth a line; a
#   timer dumping a usually-zero number is the noise that gets a subsystem
#   filtered out), with the first read only priming the baseline so a restart
#   does not report old denials as new. SIGUSR1 dumps the full status on
#   demand — whether the gate is open and WHY when it is closed — which is what
#   the rig now samples instead of scraping a boot line.
# 37: SIGUSR1 logged the summary and not the counters. sg_bpf_status() says
#   attached/armed/gate-open; `denied=` lives in sg_bpf_counters(), and only
#   the first was being logged — so a caller asking "has this refused
#   anything" got a line that could not answer and concluded no. Both now, on
#   SIGUSR1 and beside the on-change REFUSED line.
# 38: ⛔ URGENT — deny-ld-preload BRICKED A MACHINE, and 35/36/37 all carry it.
#   The rule matched ANY open of /etc/ld.so.preload. ld.so opens that file on
#   EVERY exec, and the userspace path cannot refuse an open — it can only kill
#   the opener's process TREE afterwards. So on any machine where that file
#   existed and the BPF gate was not armed (every machine: --bpf-enforce is not
#   in the unit), every command on the system had its tree torn down. Including
#   the `rm` you would use to delete the file, and sshd. Observed on velle's
#   laptop: a test that planted the file left a box where nothing could run.
#   `access write` now. A READ is what a working system does with that file; a
#   WRITE is what an attack does. The "refusing the read neuters an
#   already-planted preload" property goes with it — it was only ever available
#   to the kernel path, and it is not worth a rule that bricks a box on the
#   other one. policy_test pins the access mode.
# 39: the way out, written down where the rules are. A deny rule that matches
#   something every program does takes the whole machine with it, and the first
#   time that happened the owner's conclusion was "I will have to reinstall".
#   They did not: systemd.mask=synguard.service for ONE boot fixes it, or
#   init=/bin/bash if that will not take. ⚠ synapse.bpf_enforce=0 is NOT the
#   answer — it disarms the KERNEL gate only, and a userspace deny keeps
#   killing. Also: sg_kill_tree SIGSTOPs before tearing down, so a machine in
#   that state is usually resumable with kill -CONT, and `[[ -e path ]]` is a
#   builtin that needs no exec.
