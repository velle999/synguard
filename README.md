# synguard

A security monitor that watches process, file and network behaviour through
eBPF and classifies what it sees against a set of rules — optionally with a
local model as a second opinion.

```bash
synguard --mode audit        # watch and log, change nothing (the default)
synguard --mode enforce
synguard --mode learning
synguard --mode lockdown
synguard -d                  # foreground, verbose
```

## What it will and will not do on its own

**It starts in `audit`.** Nothing is denied until you say so, because a
security tool that begins by killing processes on an unfamiliar machine is a
tool that gets uninstalled on day one.

Two further switches gate the parts that can act:

- `--ai-enforce` lets the classifier's verdicts deny or quarantine. Without
  it the classifier is **advisory** and its verdicts are clamped to alerts —
  only rule verdicts can kill.
- `--bpf-enforce` arms the BPF-LSM gate, so an enforceable deny is refused
  in-kernel rather than the process being killed after the fact.

## Rules

Rules live in `/etc/synguard/rules.d/` (`--rules DIR` to point elsewhere).
A rule that is not armed is not enforced, and a rule that names an operation
the kernel gate does not cover cannot be enforced in-kernel however it is
written — `--mode audit` with the audit log is the way to see which of your
rules are actually doing anything before switching modes.

## Requires

`libbpf` and a kernel with BPF-LSM available for `--bpf-enforce`; without it
the monitor still runs and still classifies, and the enforcement half is
simply unavailable rather than silently inert.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/velle999/synguard
cd synguard && makepkg -si
```

makepkg fetches the source for this PKGBUILD's exact version from this
repository's releases, so a clone can only ever build the source it was
written against. `.SRCINFO` lists what it needs.

## Where this comes from

Developed in [the SynapseOS monorepo](https://github.com/velle999/SYNAPSE),
in `synguard/`. **This repository is generated from it** — the PKGBUILD, a
generated `.SRCINFO` and this README — so issues and patches belong there.
